With the progress of medical technology, people
need to extract the effective information contained in big biomedical
data to promote the development of precision medicine.
Deep learning plays an increasingly important role in the field of
medical health and has a broad prospect of application. 
 Bone Age prediction is an important medical phenomenon that is used to
monitor the growth of children and adolescents. This helps in the
detection of genetic growth disorders, and orthopedic problems
in the rudimentary stages and helps in early treatment. The
rapid advancements in technology now assist in identifying bone
age from hand radiographs using Deep learning techniques.

This code evaluates the performance of various
models and produce the highest-quality radiographic images.
The evaluation of the accuracy and the selection of the optimal pipeline
and initialization to improve precision by experimenting with
different model architectures on a large dataset of pre-processed
hand radiographs and adjusting the parameters of pre-trained
models.
### PROCESSING PIPELINE

To  understand the stages of the work, this is a presentation of 
the processing pipeline to simplify the data processing
tasks and reduce manual intervention.

•The initial step is to load and visualize the data provided
to understand it by extracting the needed information
from it.

• Pre-processing, this second step is used to clean, transform,
and prepare data before it is fed into our model. It
ensures that the data is in a suitable format for training
and that it provides the model with the information it
needs to make accurate predictions.

• The next step is to extract features. This is a significant
stage in our process pipeline as it can help to improve
the model performance, increase the interpretability of
the model, and reduce the risk of overfitting.

• The subsequent step is to build the model with the
radiograph data. We will later incorporate the gender
information and add it to the input of the model.

• After training the model, we must fine-tune the parameters
to enhance accuracy and evaluate its prediction
capabilities. Four distinct models will be trained and their
performance will be analyzed and presented in the results
section.
